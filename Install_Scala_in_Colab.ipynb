        "# Scala Installer for Colaboratory\n",
        "This notebook installs [Almond](http://almond.sh), a Scala kernel for Jupyter, into Colaboratory and configures it to make the preinstalled Python libraries accessible to Scala code (through [ScalaPy](https://github.com/shadaj/scalapy)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Because this installer is built on Almond, you get complete Scala support inside your notebooks, including the ability to get code completions and access to the [Jupyter-specific APIs](https://almond.sh/docs/api-jupyter). In addition, this installer configures Almond to be able to load preinstalled modules in Colab such as `numpy` and `tensorflow` through ScalaPy.\n",
        "\n",
        "If coming to this notebook from GitHub, make sure to **not reset your runtime** when running this notebook. In order to install the Scala kernel, the installer writes data to the runtime filesystem, so resetting would clear out the kernel.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Post-installation Setup\n",
        "After installing the Scala kernel, you will need to **completely restart the Jupyter instance** for the Scala notebook you want to run. If you are not yet connected to a Jupyter server (check the top right of your screen), you are fine and can immediately start running code.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if you previously started a Jupyter server, you must now go to `Runtime > Manage Sessions` and terminate the session for the Scala notebook. Then after reloading the page, you will see a button to connect to a server, which will start up a new Jupyter server that will now have the Scala kernel loaded.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** if your session expires and the machine is shut down, you will need to re-run this installer because Colab resets the filesystem"
